#Light Switch

This is a simple game, aimed to test your problem solving skills, the aim is to flip switches in the right order, to try and turn on all light bulbs at the same time
As simple as that might sound, before coding this, I didn't think about difficulty, so whilst all of them are 'possible', it'll take you a long time...

##UX
This website is for people looking to play a game on the internet.
Someone who has never played the game before can easily review the instructions, whilst more experienced players can review their current session stats to try and beat each level in the fewest moves possible

##features
Fully operational game
Stored instructions, score stats.

##Technologies Used
Jquery was the most used technology, adding and removing classes as well as animations for every action on the website.
I have also used hover.css in order to enhance the appearance of the nav-bar.


##Testing
I have reviewed the display on a variety of screen sizes, to ensure it always displays correctly.
All levels have been completed, to ensure they are possible, and that their stats get appropriately recorded.

##Deployment
This website was deployed on GitHub Pages

##Credits
